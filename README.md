## Bio

<p> I am a young passion driven individual who likes to be addressed as a research scientist rather than a computer scientist. I have more than 5 years experience in creating computer programs. I solve real world  problems with coding as a tool rather than just a skill. One of my most engaging hobbies includes thinking. One of my greatest desires, aim and motive in life  is to make an impact in the world in which I live using Science and Technology and I do just that. I work or want to work not to earn a living but because the passion to make an impact drives me.<br/><br/>

I am currently a high school graduate about to enter into college to offer a first in Bachelor of Science in
Computer Science where I further to complete my Master's in Biomedical Engineering.

As of experience, I have more than 4 years of experience specifically in writing web applications using Python (Django) or Ruby on rails as my backend and VueJS or React as my frontend. I use bootstrap as well for UI prototyping. I also have more than 2 years of experience in developing mobile applications with Java and less than a year in writing mobile applications with Dart (Flutter).

Self confidence, detail-orientedness, responsibility, committedness and smart working are few adjectives that describes my personality as a Scientist. As over the years, I have designed, implemented and tested complex web and mobile applications with a few other applications including network applications, system applications, desktop applications and console based applications using Python as my primary language and/or C++, C#, Java, Dart, Ruby and sometimes C. DevOPS is another field which I excel most particularly, AWS.

I always love thinking and learning but in my free times I play the musical instruments especially the piano
and sometimes I write a few blog posts on [Medium]().
